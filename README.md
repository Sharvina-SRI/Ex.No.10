# Ex.No.10 – Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 14/11/2025
## Register No.: 212222060238

## Aim:

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, answer engineering, and tail generation—can be used to create structured content including reports, articles, case studies, and creative works. The experiment highlights how prompt structure influences the quality, clarity, and depth of AI-generated content.

## Procedure:
### 1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns
Learn the following prompt patterns and their applications:

#### Query Decomposition:
Breaking down large or complex queries into smaller parts for clarity.

#### Decision Making:
Asking the model to choose between different options or content directions.

#### Answer Engineering:
Giving rules or structure for the final answer (format, headings, style).

#### Fact Check List:
Ensuring accuracy by asking the model to validate or cross-check key information.

#### Tail Generation:
Extending or continuing the story or report logically to create depth.

#### Menu Actions:
Presenting a set of actions and prompting the model to pick one to proceed.

#### Semantic Filter:
Controlling tone, style, vocabulary, or creativity level of the output.

### 2. Choosing the Content Type

Select what content you want to create, such as:

Reports (industry report, sustainability report)

Case studies (startups, business strategy)

Articles (education, awareness, opinion)

Creative content (comic story, fiction, scripts)

#### Examples:

Business report on market trends

Case study on startup success

Sci-fi short story

Article on climate change

### 3. Creating the Prompts

Begin with simple base prompts.

Gradually refine using techniques like decision-making or tone filtering.

Add structure using answer engineering.

Extend content using tail generation.

### 4. Generating and Refining Outputs

Use AI to create the first draft.

Refine using:

additional details

improved structure

enhanced tone (formal, creative, scientific)

fact-checks (for reports)

#### Examples:

Report → add graphs, insights, trends.

Story → add characters, conflict, setting.

### 5. Review and Evaluation

Evaluate content based on:

Coherence: Is it logically structured?

Creativity: Engaging and fresh?

Accuracy: Factual correctness (for reports).

Tone & style: Does it match the requirement (formal, casual, storytelling)?

### 6. Test Case Scenarios 
### Test Case 1: Business Report on Market Trends

#### Objective:
To generate a structured business report on current market trends using query decomposition, semantic filtering, and answer engineering.

#### Prompt Technique Used:
Query decomposition
Fact-check list
Answer engineering

#### Expected Output:
A formal report covering market overview, growth drivers, challenges, and future predictions.

### Test Case 2: Case Study on Business Success

#### Objective:
To create a case study that analyses how a company achieved success through strategic decisions.

#### Prompt Technique Used:
Tail generation
Decision-making prompts
Semantic filter (professional tone)

#### Expected Output:
A detailed case study including background, challenges, solutions, and results.

### Test Case 3: Article on Climate Change

#### Objective:
To create an informative article explaining the causes, effects, and solutions for climate change.

#### Prompt Technique Used:
Answer engineering
Semantic filtering (educational tone)
Query decomposition

#### Expected Output:
A multi-paragraph article with facts, examples, and awareness messaging.

### Instructions:

Select a topic.

Use simple prompts to create an initial draft.

Apply advanced prompting techniques to refine.

Evaluate clarity, accuracy, structure, creativity.

Iterate until achieving a quality final version.

### Deliverables:
#### 1. First Draft:

Basic content created using simple prompts.

#### 2. Refined Content:

Improved content applying structured prompting techniques.

#### 3. Multiple Versions:

Outputs showing differences based on prompt changes.

#### 4. Final Version:

Polished, fully structured content after iterations.

## Conclusion:

By applying various prompting techniques, high-quality and tailored content can be generated across multiple formats—reports, articles, case studies, creative narratives, and more. This experiment proves that structured prompting significantly enhances the coherence, accuracy, creativity, and overall effectiveness of AI-generated outputs.
